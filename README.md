# Your Title goes here

This is the final project on my class Computational Physics.
I want to do this, and this is how I achieve it.

## Project Structure

To read about and follow my project I suggest reading the documentation including all references *link here* first.
Please note the code is under the following license *link here* and the documentation under this license  *link here*.
The main Jupyter notebook which does this can be found *link here*.
The necessary utility functions written in *my favorite programming language* are in the *link here* UtilityFunctions folder.
To run the Jupyter notebook I suggest using the docker image *link here*.
There is also a YouTube video *link here*.


## Setup

The following commands get you started:

``` zsh
docker run *mydocker command*
```

Then do this and that to run the Jupyter notebook in your browser.

To run an optimized version of the algorithm I implemented you have to use `ctypes` and compile the files *link here* the following way:

``` zsh
docker run bash
g++ compile my code
```

## Participation

If you want to participate feel free open an issue with the appropiate labels and/or fork my project and create a pull request against the *dev* branch.
